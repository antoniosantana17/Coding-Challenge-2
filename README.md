# Coding-Challenge-2

Description
In this project, Steven needs to create a program that calculates the Amount of the Tip that he has to leave when he goes out to eat outside. The project is divided into different steps, during which the TIP will be calculated. A series of default standards include 15% of TIP for tickets between $ 50 or $ 300 and 20% of tip for other quantities. For this, we will use a land operator to determine the tip amount that will be displayed, together with the total account and value in the console. For this work, we will use the "calcTip" function to control the calculation of the TIP and test the value of a $ 100 account. Arrays will be used to handle different accounts, for which Calctip will be applied for tips and totals. The data used for work will be 275, 40, 430, 125, 555, and 44. To perform all this, we will use JavaScript with conditional functions, functions, and arrays to end with a program that serves us tips using a step-by-step approach that helps us organize the code easily and understandably.
